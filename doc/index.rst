fluomodlib
==========

``fluomodlib`` is a library for fluorescence models, i.e., forward models. A forward model is a model that calculates
experimental observables based on a set of parameters. ``fluomodlib`` can be used to calculate:

   * Fluorescence decays
   * Single-molecule FRET efficiency histograms
   * Single-molecule anisotropy histograms

Currently supported forward models:

   * Photon distribution analysis

In addition to the calculation of models, ``fluomodlib`` can be used to optimize model parameters against experimental
observables.

   * Maximum likelihood estimator (fluorescence decays)
